The `SET.py` file contains a function heavely inspired by this paper: [Transport through quantum dots: An introduction via master equation simulations](https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0002404).
This version proposes a generalization to N states and an object oriented approach for better versability. 

The `DoubleDot.py` file contains a function that simulates as its name indicates a double quantum dot. The equations used come from the work of [van der Wiel](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.75.1). The approach is based on the grand canonical ensemble equations.
